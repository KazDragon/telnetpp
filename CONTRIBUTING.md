## General

Contributions are welcome!

## Scope

Telnet++ is a C++-14 library aimed at providing an easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate implementation of the core Telnet functionality, and an extensible Option framework, including various reference implementations.  The scope of the library includes implementation of anything in the core Telnet RFCs, or any domain-specific Telnet extensions, such as those proposed within the Mudding community.

## Contributing

Contributions can be in several forms:
* Opening issues - the simplest way of contributing can be to say how you would like to use the library.  Or, alternatively, what you couldn't work out from the documentation.  Every ticket closed ends up improving the library!
* Providing fixes - any size welcome.  Spotted a typo?  You can edit this online and submit a pull request.  Have a complete new option you want to develop and integrate?  Awesome!  You can fork the repo, develop on a branch, and then submit that as a pull request.

## Guidelines

This is a C++-14 codebase, with a Standard Library/Boost look-and-feel.  Please let your tests drive your development, and keep it to around 80 characters per line to make it easier to read.  The rest is negotiable during integration.
